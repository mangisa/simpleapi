# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed

parameters:

    # the parameter name is an arbitrary string (the 'app.' prefix is recommended
    # to better differentiate your parameters from Symfony parameters).
    app.url_all_countries: 'https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all'
    # replace __name_country__ by name country to search
    app.url_country: 'https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/__name_country__' 

services:
    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.

    # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
    # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
